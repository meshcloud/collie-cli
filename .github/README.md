  platforms, including the right metadata. Includes support for CSV, YML and

- **[Analyze tag inconsistencies](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#identifying-inconsistencies-in-the-use-of-tags)** -
  See at a glance what tags are used, by which tenants (and which not), and what
  potential inconsistencies are in place to fix any governance issues.

  See who (or what) has access in what roles to what cloud tenants, including
  inherited roles from ancestors.

## ‚òùÔ∏è Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

For each cloud platform you want to manage, you'll need the equivalent cloud CLI
installed.

- For AWS, this is the `aws` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
  Do **not** use the Docker install method.
  - Make sure that you are logged into the
    [management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html),
    which is necessary for listing all AWS Accounts & costs.
- For Azure, this is the `az` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
  - Make sure that your user has access to all possible Azure Subscriptions.
    Subscriptions that you do not have access to will not be listed with Collie.
- For Google Cloud, this is the `gcloud` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart).
  - Make sure that your user has access to all possible Google Cloud Projects.
    Projects that you do not have access to will not be listed with Collie.

That's it! Let's get Collie installed ‚§µÔ∏è

## üí° Why Collie?

At [meshcloud](https://meshcloud.io/) we have years of experience in building cloud foundations in large organizations with our cloud governance platform
[meshStack](https://meshcloud.io/).

We launched Collie CLI as a tool for smaller teams to start getting more control over their clouds. 
Collie its features originate from some of the best practices of our [Cloud Foundation Maturity Model](https://www.meshcloud.io/cloud-assessment-free-poster/), which
is a tool that you can use to identify gaps in your cloud setup, define a roadmap and understand where you can save cost by improving efficiency.

## üôã‚Äç Contributor List

This project was originally kicked off by three team members at meshcloud. We
wanted to bring out some of our experience building cloud foundation teams to
the public so everyone can get a taste of what it's like to supercharge your
(multi-)cloud governance.

We are very happy to accept contributions from others as well!
