    Collie is your central helper in getting a solid foundation for your organization's
    cloud journey. Roll out and manage your core cloud architecture and landing zone(s)
    easily with Infrastructure-as-Code best-practices based on ready-made modules
    inspired by the cloud providers, such as Microsoft Azure Enterprise Scale.

## üõ†Ô∏è How does it work?

Develop and deploy landing zones to provide a solid foundation for your teams to
build on:

- Jumpstart building landing zones for all clouds with a structured and
  consistent workflow and **ready-to-use modules** from the [Collie Hub](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-hub)
- **Deploy landing zones** across all clouds - deploy landing zones to separate
  dev/prod environments using terraform
- **Automatically document** your landing zones for application teams and security stakeholders


## Getting Started

Assuming you have some cloud cli's like `aws`, `az` or `gcloud` already
installed (see [Prerequisites](#Ô∏è-prerequisites)), here's how to get started

### üïπ Installation

You can install `collie` using our install scripts below

**Linux / Ubuntu**

```sh
curl -sf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

**Mac OS X**

```sh
curl -sf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### üöÄ Connecting to your clouds

Initialize a new collie repository to hold configuration about your cloud
platforms and start the interactive configuration wizard

```shell
collie init
collie foundation new "my-foundation" # Tip: use the name of your organization here
```

### Build Landing Zones

To build landing zones with collie, follow this workflow:

```shell
# Explore available kit modules and import them from the Collie Hub
collie kit import

# Make the module available to a cloud platform in your foundation
collie kit apply "aws/my-imported-module"

# Deploy the module to your cloud foundation
collie kit apply "my-foundation"
```

You can also easily develop your own modules:

```shell
# Generate a new IaC module template
collie kit new "aws/organization-policies"

# Make the module available to a cloud platform in your foundation 
collie kit apply "aws/organization-policies" 

# Deploy the module to your cloud foundation
collie foundation deploy "my-foundation"
```

You can find more information about building and deploying landing zones with
`collie` in the [Collie documentation](https://landingzone.meshcloud.io).

## ‚òùÔ∏è Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

For each cloud platform you want to manage, you'll need the cloud CLI
installed.

- For AWS, this is the `aws` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
  Do **not** use the Docker install method.
  - Make sure that you are logged into the
    [management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html),
    which is necessary for listing all AWS Accounts & costs.
- For Azure, this is the `az` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
  - Make sure that your user has access to all possible Azure Subscriptions.
    Subscriptions that you do not have access to will not be listed with Collie.
- For Google Cloud, this is the `gcloud` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart).
  - Make sure that your user has access to all possible Google Cloud Projects.
    Projects that you do not have access to will not be listed with Collie.
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) to define landing zones using
  infrastructure as code
- [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/) to
  build and deploy terraform

_Optional_: To generate documentation of your landing zones, you will need:

- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/#installation)
  to generate terraform module documentation
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to generate and preview your cloud foundation documentation

## üëã Need help or have feedback?

Having some difficulties and need some help? No worries! Visit our forum
[here](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/discussions) and let us know what
you need help with. You can also let us know if you have any ideas on how to
improve our CLI. We're very eager to hear your thoughts.

You can also reach out to our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/meshstack)
and get in touch with us there!

## üí° Why Collie?

At [meshcloud](https://meshcloud.io/) we have years of experience in building
and operating large-scale cloud foundations in enterprise organizations
with our cloud foundation platform [meshStack](https://meshcloud.io/en/product).

We launched `collie` CLI as a tool for platform engineers and enterprise
architects that want to start getting more control over their clouds with a lean
and tried approach.

## ‚õÖÔ∏è Get visibility across clouds

Beyond Collie's cloud foundation building capabilities, Collie can also easily seek out key information
across multiple clouds:

- **[View all cloud tenants](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#listing-tenants)
  in one single overview** - View your AWS Accounts, Azure Subscriptions, and
  Google Cloud Projects with their metadata with only one command.
- **[View billing information](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#listing-costs-per-tenant)
  across all clouds** - See what you spend per day, month, or week in all cloud
  platforms, including the right metadata. Includes support for CSV, YML and
  JSON.
- **[Build a cost dashboard](https://www.meshcloud.io/2021/09/06/open-source-cloud-cost-dashboard-in-under-10-minutes/)** -
  Leverage our free-to-use Google Data Studio template and quickly build a
  multi-cloud cost dashboard using Collie cost data.
- **[Analyze tag inconsistencies](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#identifying-inconsistencies-in-the-use-of-tags)** -
  See at a glance what tags are used, by which tenants (and which not), and what
  potential inconsistencies are in place to fix any governance issues.
- **[View IAM assignments](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#listing-iam-setup-per-tenant)** -
  See who (or what) has access in what roles to what cloud tenants, including
  inherited roles from ancestors.

## üôã‚Äç Contributor List

This project was originally kicked off by three team members at meshcloud. We
wanted to bring out some of our experience building cloud foundation teams to
the public so everyone can get a taste of what it's like to supercharge your
cloud journey across all clouds

We are very happy to accept contributions from others as well!
