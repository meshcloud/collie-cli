    One project on AWS, two on Azure, and might there be something on GCP too üòµ? Collie helps you get an overview of everything going on in all your clouds.
  See your costs, IAM, tags, and more across all cloud accounts within minutes - using your existing cloud CLIs - and take control of your cloud landscape.

## ‚õÖÔ∏è Overview

- **[View all cloud tenants](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#listing-tenants) in one single overview** - View your AWS Accounts,
  Azure Subscriptions, and Google Cloud Projects with their metadata with only
  one command.
- **[View billing information](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#listing-costs-per-tenant) across all clouds** - See what you spend per day,
  month, or week in all cloud platforms*, including the right metadata. Includes
  support for CSV, YML and JSON.
- **[Analyze tag inconsistencies](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#identifying-inconsistencies-in-the-use-of-tags)** - See at a glance what tags are used, by which
  tenants (and which not), and what potential inconsistencies are in place to
  fix any governance issues.
- **[View IAM assignments](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/wiki#listing-iam-setup-per-tenant)** - See who (or what) has access in what roles to what
  cloud tenants**, including inherited roles from ancestors.

<sup><sub>*GCP does not support cost collection. Follow the issue
[here](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/issues/17) to get updated on
progress.</sub></sup><br>
<sup><sub>**AWS does not support IAM at the moment. Follow the issue
[here](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/issues/41) to get updated on
progress.</sub></sup>

## ‚òùÔ∏è Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

For each cloud platform you want to manage, you'll need the equivalent cloud CLI
installed.

- For AWS, this is the `aws` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
  Do **not** use the Docker install method.
  - Make sure that you are logged into the
    [management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html),
    which is necessary for listing all AWS Accounts & costs.
- For Azure, this is the `az` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
  - Make sure that your user has access to all possible Azure Subscriptions.
    Subscriptions that you do not have access to will not be listed with Collie.
- For Google Cloud, this is the `gcloud` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart).
  - Make sure that your user has access to all possible Google Cloud Projects.
    Projects that you do not have access to will not be listed with Collie.

That's it! Let's get Collie installed ‚§µÔ∏è

## üïπ Install and Usage

We have an easy-to-use install script prepared that will install Collie for you
in under a minute. To use it, run the command below depending on your operating
system. Additionally, check the content of the file to be sure that the install
script is safe. If you want, you could also download the
[`install.sh`](https://github.com/meshcloud/collie-cli/blob/develop/install.sh)
script in this repository and execute it locally.

## üôã‚Äç Contributor List

This project was originally kicked off by three team members at meshcloud. We
wanted to bring out some of our experience building cloud foundation teams to
the public so everyone can get a taste of what it's like to supercharge your
(multi-)cloud governance.

We are very happy to accept contributions from others as well!
