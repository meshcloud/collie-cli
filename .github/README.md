Collie is a tool for building and managing landing zones for AWS, Azure or GCP
as terraform modules.

Use collie to

- define your core cloud architecture and landing zone(s) using maintainable
  terraform modules
- discover and leverage ready-to-use modules implementing best-practice
  solutions to common landing zone challenges from
  [Collie Hub](https://collie.cloudfoundation.org/modules)
- leverage an efficient, opinionated terraform workflow that eliminates
  boilerplate and produces great documentation for application and security
  teams

## ü•ú Collie in a nutshell

Collie is a tool to streamline building and managing landing zones using
terraform for AWS, Azure and GCP. Think of collie like a wrapper around
terraform to scaffold, develop and deploy terraform modules.

- platform engineers use collie to manage a structured git repository containing
  all code defining their landing zone(s)
- collie leverages a terraform workflow (powered by terragrunt) to break down
  complex landing zones into modular, logically structured kit modules
- kit modules are standard terraform modules following minimal conventions
- collie lets you import community-maintained modules from
  [Collie Hub](https://collie.cloudfoundation.org/modules) and customize them in
  a fork & own approach

## ‚òùÔ∏è Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

To use collie, you'll need to have the following tools installed.

- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) to define landing zones using
  infrastructure as code
- [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/) to
  build and deploy terraform
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/#installation)
  to generate terraform module documentation
- (optional) [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to preview your cloud foundation
  documentation in a local webserver

For each cloud platform you want to manage, you'll need the cloud CLI installed.

- For AWS, this is the `aws` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
  Do **not** use the Docker install method.
- For Azure, this is the `az` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- For Google Cloud, this is the `gcloud` CLI. Install it
  [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart).
