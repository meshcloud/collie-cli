# Contributing to Collie

## Contributing Pull Requests

For changes on code a new branch must be created from `main`. E.g. you create a new great feature that is ready for review.
You create a branch `feature/something-really-great` and submit it as a PR against `main`.
After approval âœ… your code is merged as usual.

## How to release new code

We are using GitHub Action as CI/CD pipeline for Collie, specifically this [release workflow](.github/workflows/releases.yml).

The versions have this format `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, e.g. `v0.1.0`.

- `MAJOR` representing a breaking change
- `MINOR` indicates new features
- `PATCH` indicates backwards-compatible patches

The release is triggered on each push on `main` with a new version tag.
The triggered process makes sure that `main` always contains the code up to the tagged release version.

Direct pushes to `main` are prevented. The full workflow from forth to back is as follows:

- decide on the version number you want to use for the release
- **Important: Change the version number in `version.ts`. This process is sadly not automated at the moment.**
- create a "release vX.Y.Z" pull request containing that version number bump
- release PRs must be merged using the merge strategy 'Rebase and Merge' and NOT Squash.
- manually tag the resulting merge commit with a version tag, e.g. `git tag -a v1.4.0` and push the tag to github
- the release is created automatically by the [release workflow](.github/workflows/releases.yml)

> Note: The install script also always works with the latest version, so you're done. Nice! ðŸŽ‰
